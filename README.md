# bechlor_grade
Exceltool to calculate the Bechlor grade from the course AI (Applied Computer Science) of HTW-Berlin

The Reposetory is only there to sharing the actual Version off the Excel-tool. The Tool ist based on the document "Studienordnung 2021 - Angewandt Informatik".
Feel free to use and modify the tool. In the future i will try to improve the usebilty, but from know on is this tool only for
AI students. So that i could assume, that the most have basic Excel skills. Because of changing Requierments from diffrent sites.
I couldn't garantie the correctness of this Tool. It has no legal Claims towards the HTW-Berlin.
